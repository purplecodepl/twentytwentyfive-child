Task #1

The problem can be handled in different ways, depending on the approach and needs.
You can use the Customise â†’ Additional CSS option if the changes are small and quick to implement.
If you're editing your own theme, you can simply make changes directly in the CSS/SCSS files.
If you're editing an external theme and don't want to overwrite its files, you can create a child theme and add your styles there.

Task #2

We load styles and scripts using the wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script functions.

Task #3

Books custom post types and Genre taxonomy were added in the functions.php file.

Task #5
